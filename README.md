# 🎬 IMDb Movie Trends – Predictive Modeling & Trend Analysis

This project explores patterns in the top 100 highest-rated IMDb movies, applying data cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to uncover insights about movie performance. It combines Python-based regression techniques with interactive Power BI dashboards for trend analysis.


## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: IMDb's Top 100 Highest-Rated Movies  
- **Scope**: Title, Year, Runtime, Genre, Director, Actors, Rating, Votes, Gross, Meta_Score


## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python (scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib)** – Data analysis & regression modeling  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation & visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


## 🔍 Project Goals

- Predict missing `Gross` and `Meta_Score` values using machine learning  
- Create derived features to improve analysis (e.g., rating-to-gross ratio)  
- Analyze patterns by genre, director, release year, and actor contribution  
- Build interactive visuals to explore trends and top performers


## ⚙️ Key Steps

✔ Cleaned and transformed raw IMDb dataset  
✔ Handled missing data using regression-based imputation  
✔ Engineered new features for deeper insights  
✔ Built regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree)  
✔ Visualized results and trends using Power BI


## 📊 Power BI Report Features

- **Rating Trends**: Year-over-year rating distribution  
- **Top Directors & Genres**: Average rating and gross by director and genre  
- **Actor Performance**: Frequency and impact of top actors  
- **Gross vs Rating Analysis**: Scatter plots with regression lines  
- **Missing Data Prediction**: Comparison between predicted and actual values


## 📈 Skills Demonstrated

- Data Wrangling with Pandas  
- Machine Learning Regression (Linear Regression, DecisionTreeRegressor)  
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Power BI)  
- Feature Engineering  
- Dashboard Design & Storytelling
